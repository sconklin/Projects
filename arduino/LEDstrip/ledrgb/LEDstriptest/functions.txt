Input Parameters:

    STRIPLEN = number of LEDs in the strip

Internal Parameters:

    PatternType
    PatternOffset = current start of pattern
    redPatternBits
    greenPatternBits
    bluePatternBits

Functions:

lightOne(n,r,g,b) - light the nth LED in the specified color 

setEveryNth(offset, N, r, g, b, skip) - set every nth LED starting at offset, until end
                                        - if skip is set, leave other LEDs as is (no latch bit)

definePattern(uint32 redPatternBits, uint32 greenPatternBits, uint32 bluePatternBits)

setPattern(offset) - set the LEDs to the defined pattern, starting at offset

shiftPattern(direction) - shift the pattern one LED (LEFT or RIGHT)

=======================================
General ideas

Brightness steps of 1/64 (2X)

To generate a fading effect, say you have LEDs 0-20

000000000011111111112
012345678901234567890
          ^          

Fade up from Center
Send all to off

send 10 fade up, skip all others
clock fade 8 times (8)
send 9,11 fade up, skip all others
clock fade 8 times (16)
send 8, 12 fade up, skip all others
clock fade 8 times (24)
send 7, 13 fade up, skip all others
clock fade 8 times (32)
send 6, 14 fade up, skip all others
clock fade 8 times (40)
send 5, 15 fade up, skip all others
clock fade 8 times (48)
send 4, 16 fade up, skip all others
clock fade 8 times (56)
send 3, 17 fade up, skip all others
clock fade 8 times (64) - 10 is now at full!!
send 10 fade down, 2, 18 fade up, skip all others
clock fade 8 times (56)
send 1, 19 fade up, 9, 11 fade down, skip all others
etc
